        <p><h3><b>Subjects Of study</b></h3> <br>
        </p>
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility--as long the subject fall
        somewherre in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued 
        by are as follows, in order of priority: <br>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li> <br>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>0</sup>C (86<sup>0</sup>F), when the audience
                 size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>> 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li> <br>
            <li><abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="CSS">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li> <br>

        </ol>
        <br>
        So plese can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the 
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks. <br>

        <p><h3><b>Exotic dance moves</b></h3><br>
        </p>
        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions: <br>
        <br>
        Polynesian chicken dance <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little know but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="BC">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around 
        in a circle like chickens, to encourage their live stock or be "fruiful". <br>
        Icelandic brownian shuffle <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Icelanders developed fire as means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, wich 
        involved hudding close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably 
        tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired 
        modem styles such as Twerking. <br>
        Arctic robot dance <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have 
        discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants
        of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this 
        because they were really cold. <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        Yours sincerely, <br>
        <br>
